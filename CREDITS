Credits to idrae_ for the original mod idea, Towers of the Wild (although original code, data or assets were not used on this mod).

Additional thanks to TelepathicGrunt for their structure tutorial (licenced under CCO-1.0 licence at the time of writing);
and to xPand4B, who created the Fabric version of Towers of the Wild (licenced under MIT licence at the time of writing);

TelepathicGrunt's Structure Tutorial (https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/StructureTutorialMod) is used as a general frame for the mod;
on the other hand, certain lines of code from xPand4B (specifically from: https://github.com/xPand4B/Towers_Of_The_Wild_Reworked/blob/main/src/main/java/waldinet/towers_of_the_wild_reworked/utils/ModUtils.java) were used to solve author discrepancies when integrating Waystones compatibility.
